# Star Platinum CubeMX Project
This project is a firmware for an STM32 microcontroller using STM32CubeMX and HAL libraries.
It initializes GPIO, I2C, and TIM peripherals and interfaces with the CH452 LED driver module to control a display.

## Project Overview    
MCU: STM32 (specific model depends on your CubeMX setup)

Framework: STM32 HAL

### Peripherals Used:

GPIO

I2C1

TIM1, TIM3
